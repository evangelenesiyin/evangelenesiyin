## 👩🏻‍💻 About Me

Hello, I'm Evangelene!

I'm a software developer based in Singapore and I come with a background in business development and 7 years of working experience in the healthcare/meditech and legal industries. I started coding in 2022 and decided to make a full switch to software engineering to make an impact and help others through the web applications I create.
